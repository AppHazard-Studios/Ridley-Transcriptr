# Ridley Transcriptr

**Automatic transcript downloader for Ridley College Moodle videos**

---

## 🎯 Overview

**Ridley Transcriptr** is a lightweight Manifest V3 Chromium extension designed to download clean transcripts
from Vimeo videos embedded in Ridley College's Moodle platform.

On supported pages, the extension automatically detects all embedded Vimeo videos.  
You can manage downloads directly from the extension popup:

- **Download individual transcripts** with a single click
- **Bulk download all available video transcripts at once**

Captured transcripts are cleaned for study use — with full sentences (no broken line breaks) and no timestamps — and
saved as `.txt` files, ready for referencing or uploading into study tools and databases.

The popup interface is **intentionally minimal and uncluttered**, designed for fast, distraction-free use.

## 🔒 Privacy, Offline Behavior & Study Integrity

Ridley Transcriptr is a **100% local extension** — it does not communicate with any servers or external services beyond
what your browser already does to access Moodle or Vimeo content.

All transcript detection, processing, and file generation happen entirely on your own device.

While an internet connection is required to access your Moodle page and load Vimeo videos, the extension itself operates
fully on your computer without sending or receiving any additional data.

Using this extension does **not** break any academic rules or access restricted materials.  
It simply allows you to save transcripts associated with videos you are already authorized to access through your
institution's Moodle platform.

We strongly support **study integrity**. Ridley Transcriptr is intended to assist with note-taking, revision, and study
preparation — not to gain an unfair academic advantage.  
Use responsibly and in line with your institution's academic policies.
