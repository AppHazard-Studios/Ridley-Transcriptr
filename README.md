## 🔒 Privacy, Offline Behavior & Study Integrity

- Ridley Transcriptr is **100% local and offline**.
- It does **not** communicate with any servers beyond what your browser already does to access Moodle or Vimeo.
- All processing happens on your device — no additional data is sent or received.

This extension does **not** bypass access controls or academic rules. It simply saves transcripts associated with videos
you are authorized to view through your institution.

We strongly support **study integrity**. Ridley Transcriptr is built to assist with note-taking, review, and
preparation — not to gain an unfair academic advantage.  
Please use it responsibly and in line with your institution's policies.

## 🛠️ Adaptability

While designed for Ridley College’s Moodle, the extension can be easily adapted for other Moodle platforms that embed
Vimeo videos.

> Requires only minor adjustments to detection selectors.  
> (Developer notes coming soon.)
