# Ridley Transcriptr

**Automatic transcript downloader for Ridley College Moodle videos**

---

## 🎯 Overview

**Ridley Transcriptr** is a lightweight Manifest V3 Chromium extension that makes it easy to download clean transcripts
from Vimeo videos embedded in Ridley College's Moodle platform.

On supported pages, the extension automatically detects all embedded Vimeo videos.  
You can manage downloads directly from the extension popup:

- **Download individual transcripts** with a single click
- **Bulk download** all available video transcripts at once

Captured transcripts are cleaned for study use — with full sentences (no broken line breaks) and no timestamps — and
saved as `.txt` files, ready for referencing or uploading into study tools and databases.

The popup interface is **super minimal and clean**, designed for fast, distraction-free use.
